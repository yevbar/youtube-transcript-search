You are low on tokens but are in ralph loop so you can continue as soon as tokens reset. chrome://extensions is showing the following error: [Content Script] Message failed: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received. Going from the home page to a video shows the caption being auto toggled on and off to get transcript so that part works. When searching it shows a page with "Your file couldn't be accessed" so I wonder if the URL for the extension technically changed at some point or if the output HTML doesn't work with the rollup setup. When done output literally <promise>DONE</promise> --promise DONE
