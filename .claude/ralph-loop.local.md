You are in a ralph loop so if you run out of tokens you should restart when tokens reset. I am attempting to have the popup have two 'tabs'. One for searching in the current video and one for searching all transcripts. I was attempting to have the right 'tab' be hightlighted on startup depending on whether or not there are captions to search through. Instead I mistakingly query the document of the popup.html. Help me fix. When done out exactly <promise>COMPLETE</promise> --promise COMPLETE
